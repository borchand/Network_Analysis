1. How are we going to manage someone else using our project? 

The thing is, the data on Kaggle is updated each week, and HistoricalData
is hard-coded. That could throw some errors if the newest dates don't match. 

That could be solved by setting this to how="right" and therefore trimming the newest data

From clean.py (add market index)

## Join df with hist_data on Date
x = df.join(hist_data.set_index('Date')['Close/Last'], on='Date', how='left', lsuffix='_caller', rsuffix='_other').rename(columns={'Close/Last': 'COMP'})
